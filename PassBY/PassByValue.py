#=============================== Pass By Value =========================================

# Python does not have pure pass by value. Instead, it uses “Pass by Object Reference” (or “Call by Sharing”).


#---------- Immutable ( Like Pass By Value )

# def modify(x):
#     x = x + 5
#     print("Inside Function: ", x)
# num = 10
# modify(num)
# print("Outside Function: ", num)
