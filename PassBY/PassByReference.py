#================================== Pass By Reference ===========================================


# Python does not have pure pass by reference. Instead, it uses “Pass by Object Reference” (or “Call by Sharing”).


#---------- Mutable ( Like Pass By Reference )



# def modify(list):
#     list.append(100)
#     print("Inside Function", list)
# num = [1,2,3]
# modify(num)
# print("Outside Function", num)
